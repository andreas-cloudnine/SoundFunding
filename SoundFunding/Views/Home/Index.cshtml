<p>Like music? Want to make the world a better place? Why not combine the two? 
    On SoundFunding you can raise money for your favorite cause while listening to the music you love. It's that easy.</p>

<p>SoundFunding is a service where 100 % of the earnings from a specific play list is donated to a cause and a charity donation of your choice. All you need to do is
    <ol>
        <li>Specify a cause and upload a suitable image</li>
        <li>Specify a goal for your fundraising</li>
        <li>Choose you favourite charity organisation</li>
        <li>Share the information about your cause to all you friends, inviting them to join you</li>
    </ol>

<p>SoundFunding will then create a play list by combining 3 of the favourite artists of each one joining your cause. 
    The longer you and your friends listen to the play list, the more money you raised. And it doesn't cost any of you 
    anything else than the chance of listening to other tunes than what you're used to.</p>
